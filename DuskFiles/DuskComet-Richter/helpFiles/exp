You earn exp from killing mobs, it cannot be given by other players.
The exp you earn is based on your cp and the mob's cp and the damage you do.
        (see stats for an explanation of cp)
Basically, the bigger mob you kill while your cp stays the same, the more exp you get.
Using armor and weapons adds to your cp as far as exp goes, so using great armor and
        a great weapon will get you less exp than just enough armor and no weapon.
If you have a pet, are following someone, or join a fight, the rules change a little.
        exp is handed out based on the damage you do, the more damage you do,
        the more exp you earn.  When you are in a fight using a pet or another player,
        you want to do as much damage as you can, and that means using a good weapon.
        If your pet or the other player does more damage than you, they will get
        a greater share of the damage done.  So it is not so much a greater
        share of the exp, but a greater share of the damage done, which is used
        to figure out how much exp you should get.
