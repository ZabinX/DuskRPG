	chat trigger "Xyphoid says: I couldn't find a way back through the bushes so I checked the surrounding area and there was a small cave enterence behind the mountain."
	chat trigger "Xyphoid says: Inside the cave there where dozens of flans.  All of em' rushed to attack me and some of them would even spit fire.  Boy were they mad at me for killing their kin."
	chat trigger "Xyphoid says: I fought my way though the fire and lava...then I herd water up ahead.  I was so thirsty, I bolted straight to the source and took a drink."
