100 is max for skills, just like stats.
All skills happen automatically.
The more you train in a skill, the better chance you have of it happening.
So a Double Attack:  1, is not very useful, but a Double Attack: 30,
        will start to show up in combat.
Double Attack, Triple Attack, and Quadruple Attack all add an additional
        attack to your battle rounds so getting Quad first will still only get
        you 1 extra attack.  Getting them in order makes more sense,
        but is not required.
Dodge allows you to dodge enemy attacks, but even with Dodge:  100,
        you will still get hit
Disguise:  Not all races are well liked, so to get into some areas,
        you may find this skill useful.
