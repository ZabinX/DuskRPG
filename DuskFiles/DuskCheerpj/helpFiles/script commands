(not short circuit)and <statement1> <statement2> - if both statements returns true, and returns true. (not short circuit)< <value1> <value2> - if value1 is less than value 2, returns true.< <value1> <value2> - if value1 is less than value 2, returns true.isInBattle <livingthing> - if the livingthing is in a battle, returns true.isPlayer <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a player, returns true.isPet <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a pet, returns true.isMob <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a mobile, returns true.isClan <livingthing> <string> - returns true if the livingthing's clan is equal to the string.isRace <livingthing> <string> - returns true if the livingthing's race is equal to the string.hasItem <livingthing> <itemname> - if livingthing has this item, returns true.giveItem <livingthing> <itemname> - gives the livingthing this item.createmob <mobname> <xloc> <yloc> - creates a mob at the specified location.createoneusemob <mobname> <xloc> <yloc> - creates a one use mob at the specified location.

However, you can also set variables globally by proceeding the declaration with the "global" keyword.Variable names can only be one word, and you should take care not to overlap variable names or get them confused with commands.livingthing <name> <value> - declares a new livingthing variable with the specifies name and value. number <name> <value> - declares a number variable.string <name> <value> - declares a string variable.
