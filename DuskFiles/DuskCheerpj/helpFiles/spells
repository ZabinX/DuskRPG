- 100 is max for spell groups, just like stats.
- You get spells at merchants, not all merchants have spells.
- Each spell group (usually) has more than one spell in it.
- The more you train in a spell group, the more spells you can cast 
	from that group, and the cheaper the early spells in the group are to cast.
- To cast a spell, you type 'cast spellname <target>' not all spells have
	targets.  If a spell name has two words like 'detect invis' from the
	Enchantment group, you need to enclose the name of the spell in
	double quotes when you cast it.
- Some spells only work when you are in combat, like thorns from Druidic group.
- When you first get Clerical group, you can cast mend for 47 or so MP.
	When you have Clerical group at 100, mend only costs 5 MP to cast,
	and you 6 or so other spells you can cast as well.
- Clerical group is the easiest spell group to get into as the power of the
	spells is governed by your wis stat which is the same stat that gonverns
	how fast you recover MP after casting a spell.  Most other groups use int.
- Some spells, like those in the Warrior group, allow for cumulative effects.
	The higher your cp, the more times the spells can be cast on you.
	The spells in warrior group give you 1 extra casting every 500cp.
- Some spells, like those in Elemental Fire and Elemental Ice, require
	that you have certain rare spell components in order to cast them.

        Clerical group
