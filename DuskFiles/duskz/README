CODE STATUS Feburary 2023
-------------------------

Well I can't believe it's been 10 years ... but Xyphoid asked me if i
still had the source around so i dug it out and did a bit of work to
make it build with the latest OpenJDK and JavaFX.  I also decided to
modularise it, it wasn't much work and it simplifies building,
particulalry inside Netbeans.

This version builds with OpenJDK 19, JavaFX 19, and Netbeans 17,
although it should work with earlier versions (OpenJDK 11 or 17
perhaps).

This branch is before the berkeleydb work although that was never
implemented anyway and isn't hard to merge in.

CODE STATUS September 2013
--------------------------

After a very active development period the work simply stopped - so it
is in a bit of a half-way state as you'd imagine.  Other time
pressures and interests meant I haven't had time to work on this for
months but I hope to again one day in some shape or form.

Essentially the code in duskz/server and duskz/server/entity is the
original Dusk code which has been refactored a bit (badly), updated to
newer Java and a new protocol (I think), but more or less shares the
original features and data format.  It's basically a dead branch.

The code in dusk/server/entityz is mostly a complete re-write of the
object class hierarchy, data i/o, map handling and a few other things.
Unfortunately as it was in active development when it stopped it too
isn't entirely in a good state either.

I think the object heirarchy is pretty good, and the script system was
"upgraded" to javascript but there is a ton of work left to make it
usable.  In hindsight i should've gone straight to a database
(berkeleydb) backend as too much of the entity code is dealing with
i/o.

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a fork and major overhaul of the Dusk 2.7.3 source code,
released circa 2000.  The main changes are updating for 20 years of
Java progress, a new binary network protocol, and a (rudimentary)
JavaFX client.

A compatible game is required - each server implementation uses
slightly different game formats.

This is currently in an alpha state.

 ... to be completed ...

BUIDING
-------

Copy config.make.in to config.make and configure for your local setup.

Then get the 3rd party libraries from maven:

$ make maven-init

Then build everything:

$ make

TODO: make a jlink target
TODO: Netbeans

INSTALLATION
------------

TODO: depends on jlink thing
TODO: where to put game files

RUNNING
-------

See the Makefile targets run-server, run-server-old, and run-client.
