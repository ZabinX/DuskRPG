This lists some changes to files to support multiple maps.

Map files
---------

Maps are encoded in a binary format and stored in multiple files under
defMaps/

The filename of the map is the name as referenced elsewhere.

LivingThing
-----------

New parameter 'map' supplies the name of the map the thing is on.

mobs
----

Added the map name to the mob entries.  Changed the header name from
'mob2.3' to 'mob'.

merchants
---------

Each entry in the merchants file now starts with

mapname
xlocation
ylocation

rather than xlocation.
