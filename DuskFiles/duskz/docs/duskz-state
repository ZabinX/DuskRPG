Online game state is stored in state files which are semi-serialised
versions of things.

Format
------

The format is the same as other object files - pseudo-properties format,
but each object is wrapped in a container.

type=Class,objectname
properties
=end

Class is the name of the class (relative to duskz.server.entity) this
object represents.

objectname is the name of the object prototype, e.g. name of the mob,
item, etc.

Saving process
--------------

1. Write envelope header (class,name)
2. Write volatile state variables, by calling Thing.writeState()
3. Write envelope footer

Loading process
---------------

1. Read envelope header.
2. Instantiate object of type
3. Load object prototype using Thing.load(name)
4. Read volatile state variables and set them via setProperty()
5. Until envelope footer is encountered.
