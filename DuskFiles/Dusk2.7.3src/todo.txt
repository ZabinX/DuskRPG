*DONE* Fix reloadprefs ... it does not work.

4 vectors of mobs.
	all of the mobs.
	just the dead ones.
	just the ones that can see players.
	just the ones that need to regen hp or mp.
This might speed up computation associated with mobs.

*DONE*isSaving boolean for the game engine.
	use to disable multiple saves at the same time.
	prevent changes to map, mobs, merchants, props, signs, etc while saving.

Allow names of game files to be set in prefs.
	mobs, signs, shortmap, props, merchants, etc...

Allow names of stats to be set in prefs.
	this should not affect how the game accesses them
	not sure if it should affect scripts or not

*DONE*Allow display of item totals in inventory

Allow dropping/giving of specific inventory items

Limit size of inventory based on strength/cp

*DONE* kill script function
	kill trigger "poison"  - this would kill the player, trigger the
		onDeath scripts and gecho that the player had been killed by poison.

Allow player/pet renaming race change up to a certain cp
*DONE* with allowing race change

Take away god ability to create items on the map, make it a spell group/command
	that puts it in their inventory instead.  Might also want to take away the
	ability to drop items, so they have to be given.

Add a start/form clan command that allows players to make their own damn clans.
	Will need to use the dirty word filter.

*DONE* Make wear/unwear/use case insensitive since items are case insensitive

*DONE*Make an ItemList class that overrides the vector operations (addElement,
	etc) to allow for the inventory operations above.
Add an unreceived send limit to LivingThing and abort sends after this limit
	has been reached.
Create a message protocol for sending messages to the client, so the client
	can recover cleanly from an "lost incoming byte" error state by skipping
	to the next message header.
Change all file access to be SQL based
	player files
	script files (move action, can move, commands, spells, etc)
	compiled script files
	conditions
	item definitions
