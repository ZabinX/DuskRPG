			Clan Rules
To join an existing clan, you need to be invited in by a clan leader
Many clans have restrictions on who can join...
	must have 200cp, must pay 5000gp, etc
To create a clan, you need to have at least 200cp,
	and 2 other players, also with 200cp
	All players must be present when the god creates the clan.
	The length of the clan name can be either a 3 letter acronym or a 4 letter word.
Castles are limited in number.  There is one key for each Castle.
When the leader of a clan picks up a castle key, his clan gains access to that castle.
If the leader is killed, he drops the key.
The clan will lose access to the castle if another leader picks up the key.
You can only have access to one castle at a time.
