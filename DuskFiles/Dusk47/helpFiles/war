Rules for waging war
=====================
Only a clan leader can declare war on another clan.
War is declared by naming a member of the enemy clan who is in the world at the time.
    You cannot declare war on a clan if none of their members are in the world.
War are one clan vs. one clan.  Allies can help through following or joining of fights, but
    straight kills from allies will not count in the war.
The world can only support a limited number of simultaneous wars (4 at the moment).
    Once this limit is reached, you must wait for another war to end before starting yours.
A leader from the clan who is winning the war can end it at any time.
A leader from the clan who is losing the war can only end it by surrendering to a leader
    from the clan who started the war (this will probably cost some gp).
