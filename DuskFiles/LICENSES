Last update: 2012.11.18

**NOTE**Dusk's sourcecode is GPL, and any art Dusk used back in the day is also GPL.  The art included in "DuskMapEditor" and in the "www/rc/somedusk/images" is not licensed and is just there as a placeholder until Dusk get's developed further.  I've included "img" folder with proper licenses because I would *love* to use those tiles in Dusk.

This file is listing all the files licenses from the point of the fork
from the Allacrost project.
Note: The licensing of the allacrost's files is assumed to be GPLv2 or later,
as told on the allacrost web site:
