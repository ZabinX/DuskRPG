Declaring variables:
Variables are by default set locally, meaning they are only useable within the script. However, you can also set variables globally by proceeding the declaration with the "global" keyword.
Variable names can only be one word, and you should take care not to overlap variable names or get them confused with commands.
livingthing <name> <value> - declares a new livingthing variable with the specifies name and value. 
number <name> <value> - declares a number variable.
string <name> <value> - declares a string variable.
