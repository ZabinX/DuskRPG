                Section 1: Basic commands ( As best put in easy to understand words)

Just so you know...only High and Master Gods can edit scripts and submit them. Normal Gods just make tiles.
 


! - reverses the value of a condition (basically makes the script do opposite of what its supposed to do)
not - same as ! (same as above)
if - if following condition returns true, runs all script until end.(if things are as theyre supposed to be...it makes script keep going till it finishes)
end - ends an if statement. (ends can be nested)
playSound <Sound ID> <X location> <Y location> - plays the sound specified at that location. (Obvious)
order <livingthing> <command> - orders a livingthing (player, mob, pet) to execute that command. Essentially the same as having the player type something into the command line or ordering a pet to do something.
hasCondition <livingthing> <condition> - returns true if livingthing has specified condition.
addCondition <livingthing> <condition> - adds the condition to a livingthing. (If the thing has this condition...it goes onto next part of script)
addConditionWithDuraction <livingthing> <condition> <duration> - adds the condition for specifies duration.
removeCondition <livingthing> <condition> - removes the condition from the livingthing.
addflag <livingthing> <flag> - adds the specified flag to the livingthing. (A flag is the name that gets put on you. EX: <safe>Cyril )
removeflag <livingthing> <flag> - removes a flag from a livingthing. 
livingthing <name> <value> - declares a new livingthing variable with the specifies name and value. (Note: all variable names can only be one word)
number <name> <value> - declares a number variable.
string <name> <value> - declares a string variable.
or <statement1> <statement2> - if either statement returns true, or returns true. (not short circuit)
and <statement1> <statement2> - if both statements returns true, and returns true. (not short circuit)
< <value1> <value2> - if value1 is less than value 2, returns true. (Dont worry about these for a while. Hardly used)
< <value1> <value2> - if value1 is less than value 2, returns true. (Dont worry about these for a while. Hardly used)
isInBattle <livingthing> - if the livingthing is in a battle, returns true. (Duh)
isPlayer <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a player, returns true. (Duh)
isPet <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a pet, returns true. (Duh)
isMob <livingthing> - if the livingthing is a mobile, returns true. (Duh)
isClan <livingthing> <string> - returns true if the livingthing's clan is equal to the string. (More complicated....explained Below)
isRace <livingthing> <string> - returns true if the livingthing's race is equal to the string. (More complicated....explained Below)
hasItem <livingthing> <itemname> - if livingthing has this item, returns true. (If the person or pet has the item...it goes on to finish script)
giveItem <livingthing> <itemname> - gives the livingthing this item. (Gives Item)
removeItem <livingthing> <itemname> - removes this item from the livingthing. (Removes this item from the person of pets inventory)
isWearing <livingthing> <itemname> - returns true if the livingthing is wearing this item.
unWear <livingthing> <itemname> - forces this livingthing to unwear the item. (Makes thing take off the item....or a script for what happens of they take off the item)
variableIsNumber <variablename> - returns true if this variable is a number.
variableIsLivingThing <variablename> - returns true if this variable is a livingthing.
variableIsString <variablename> - returns true if this variable is a string.
chat <livingthing> <string> - chats a message to a livingthing.
endscript - ends the script.
inc <livingthing> <value> <increment value> - increments the value by a specified increment.
set <livingthing> <value> <set value> - sets the value to a specific number
Below are listed values that can be incremented or set:
hp
maxHp
hpBonus
mp
maxMp
mpBonus
damDone
strength
intelligence
dexterity
wisdom
constitution
strengthBonus
intelligenceBonus
dexterityBonus
wisdomBonus
constitutionBonus
acBonus
damModBonus
locX
locY
exp
cash

***NOTE**** DO NOT USE SET FOR CERTAIN ITEMS OR THE PLAYERS WILL HATE YOU! YOU DONT WANT A GUYS MAX HP GOING

FROM 1200 to 200 ON ACCOUNT OF A MISTAKE YOU MADE! SAME THING WITH INC. BE CAREFUL OF WHAT U MAKE

ALWAYS TEST YOUR ITEMS ON A FAKE CHARACTER FIRST! 


                       Section 2: Making your first script (oooo...so exciting eh?)


If your script doesnt run all the way through...you screwed up on something.

Ok...lets make ourselves an item. Name it.... God Exp. Type View item God Exp. A blank Window should

come up. Fill the following in:

type
item
description
(write a description you get when you look at this item)
cost
(how much you want it to cost)
image
(what image number it uses....preferably 6 depending on what it is)
onuse
(only put onuse if your item is going to have a script. Some items dont...such as demon horns)
uses
(just put 1)
.

MAKE SURE YOU PUT A PERIOD ON THE LAST LINE! 

Heres an example of the Ale File:

type
item
description
some ale.
cost
10
image
6
onuse
ale
uses
1
.




Not so hard to comprehend...is it? 

Now...lets fill in those blanks. Make it look like this:

type
item
description
When used..it gives you 5000 EXP.
cost
0
image
6
onuse
t god exp (make sure you put the t)
uses
1
.


On the bottom of the window....click the Submit button. Then close this window.

Now type view script god exp

In the blank script window type this:

inc trigger exp 5000 ( this will add 5000 exp for that person)
chat trigger " You get 5000 exp" (make sure to put a space between the first quote and first letter)
endscript (ends the script for good)

****NOTE****** Where up above you see <Livingthing> its another name for a special command. Use trigger. 
Its used 99% of time.

Now....you wonder...ok...inc adds the number....how is set diffrent? ( ill show you)

set trigger exp 5000 (makes ur exp 5000 no matter what it is)
chat trigger " You have 5000 exp now"
endscript


If the person has 7000 exp with them...and they use this....will lose 2000 exp. Instead of 12000 they will have 5000.


Now...make it back to inc trigger exp 5000 and submit it using the button on the bottom.

Now close this window. Back in the dusk game type <God Exp

An item should appear below you. It should look like a little golden bag or pot. Pick it up.

Now type use "God Exp" (if an item you make has more than 1 word...you need quotes around it.)

If it worked correctly...it should give you 5000 exp. IF you get an error saying:

( " This has no use|.3588 or something like that.. Delete the t written before the name of your script in the item. Instead of t God Exp just try God Exp.)


If it has worked...Excellent! You just made your first working script for an Item! (So invigorating isnt it? =P )

Now...let me tell you about the chat trigger script command.


				Section 3: The chat trigger command

So far you've learned a bit about the set command and inc command. set changes the value to what you want it to be.

inc command adds or subtracts ( Ill show you that later) values you want it to. Now lets learn

the stupidly easy chat script.

To chat something on an item or tile(Also explained later) type this:

chat trigger " blah blah"  (dont forget the space between the first quote and letter.)
endscript ( or something else you want script to do first)


EXAMPLE:

chat trigger " Im writing this help manual."
endscript


Simple no?


                               Section 4: Flags ( ya know..<safe> is an example of a flag.)

Making flags is as easy as the chat trigger. 

addflag trigger <name of flag> (The flag must be surrounded by < > )
endscript

Example:

addflag trigger <Moo>
endscript

****NOTE**** This doesnt put the person in a clan. Only clanleaders and gods can put peoples in clans.

To remove a flag:

removeflag trigger <flag name>
endscript

Example:

removeflag trigger <Moo>
endscript

Thats it. :) Thats all you need to know about flags.



                                 Section 5: Adding Bonuses

Adding Bonuses is very easy.

Adding a strength bonus:

inc trigger strengthBonus (number)
endscript

Adding a Dexterity Bonus

inc trigger dexterityBonus (number)

They go on like that. Look to find which things can have bonuses.

Examples: 

Strength Bonus

inc trigger strengthBonus 10   (will add 10 bonus points)
endscript

AC Bonus

inc trigger acBonus 20  (will add + 20 to your AC)
endscript

Wisdom Bonus

inc trigger wisdonBonus 6  (adds 6 bonus points to your wisdom.)
endscript


Thats basically it. Experiment with the other Bonuses to.



               Section 6: Can Move scripts

As you know. Some tiles are walkable and others arent. To make a tile walkable only if that person

has an item this is how you do it:


hasItem trigger (item name)

If you want to make it so they CANT pass here if they have a certain item...type this:

! hasItem trigger (item)



			Section 7: Tile Scripts

Theyre are basically 2 types. Can move and move action. To view the script for a certain tile..

its name is its coordinates. In other words. 1_1 would be filled in with script you would want

to happen when you step on 1/1. Can move is only for if they can move or not. Move action is what 

happens when they step on the tile. It can be the tile gives items...heals..or teleports :)


			Section 8: Subtracting Stats

Just inc the thing with a negative.

Example:

inc trigger acBonus -12  ( take away 12 bonus points from AC)

inc trigger hp -20     (makes hp go down 20 points)

You get it right??


			

Its 3:00 AM....and im sooo sleepy....but i cant sleep. I have insomnia.  Go figure.


			Section 9: Teleporter Tiles  ( Awesome huh?)

You can actually design tiles that will teleport people to a certain location. To make things better

its actually very easy to write. There are 2 diffrent ways to write this. Most of the time...

its the first way. Heres the first way:

set
trigger
locx
(coord number on x- axis)
set
trigger
locy
(coord number on y- axis)
endscript


Example:

set
trigger
locx
12
set
trigger
locy
10
endscript


This will teleport you to 12/10 on the map.


The Second way:

set trigger locxy (locx number) (locy number)
endscript


***NOTE*** Always test your teleporter with a fake character first!


	Thats basically it. Make sure you put this in a move action not a can move.


			
				Section 10:Complicated Stuff

By now you should know how to put conditions on by learning from the other script commands.
Lets show you some complicated stuff. Heres a example for someones house.


if ispet trigger
	endscript
end
if ! hasItem trigger house1key
	chat trigger "This isn't your house!"
	inc trigger locx -1
end
endscript


Daunting huh? Well...let me show you what each part means

if ispet trigger
	endscript
end

This means that if a pet is going over this tile it should end the script. The end simply ends
that if statement


if ! hasItem trigger house1key
	chat trigger "This isn't your house!"
	inc trigger locx -1


You remember if, !, and, hasItem. In english it means...if you dont have house1key...goto next line

of the script. There is the chat trigger. See where it says:

inc trigger locx -1

This means when it gets to this point...it will move your character away.

See...when explained in english its not hard.

end
endscript

This ends the if statement and endscript stops it all.

WOW....see...easy to understand. Now that you shoulve understood this...it will 

inspire you to design others.

***NOTE*** ispet can be changed to isclan or israce....but if u change it...u must specify a race...or clan.
