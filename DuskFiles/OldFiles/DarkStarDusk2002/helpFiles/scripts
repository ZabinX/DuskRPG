Scripts
SEE ALSO "help scripting" for a walkthrough

For a full list of script commands, type "help script commands"

Scripts are used by Dusk to perform customizable tasks. 
You can use scripts to write spells, commands, tile movement, etc.
To edit scripts, open/create them using the view and submit commands.
There are two types of scripts, condition scripts and task scripts.
Task scripts include spells, commands, and move actions.
Condition scripts include can move, can see, and canAttack scripts.
Task scripts are run from beggining to end, while condition scripts
evaluate the first statement and return it's value.
For instance, a task script may say:

Livingthing player param1
chat player "Hello player!"
endscript

While a condition script may say:

hasItem trigger "long sword"

This may seem like gibberish now, but read some of the example files
and it should begin to make sense soon. Good luck and happy scripting!
