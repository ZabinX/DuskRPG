This an introductory file to help you learn how to script using most of the operators to help create
impressive files that make the world of dusk more functional. I will be working on this help file throughout
the time that I am actually on, so it will be slow to begin with.

The first part of a very extensive file is being worked on, and is mostly
completed. I will (hopefully) be working on the file throughout the spring
break, so until then, I have the introductary file up, although it will be
revised later on.
