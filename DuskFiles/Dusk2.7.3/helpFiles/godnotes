Notes all gods:

	~Your password should be different on ALL dusk worlds.
		It makes it easy to hack your file if another player finds it in
		another world.

	~swords of slaying, questswords, ork banes, and anything else
		containg the word "quest" are not to be for sale anywhere.
		further information can be obtained by typing "help quest items"

	~strabo is available only in castle strabo.

	~There is to be one and only one strabo key.

	~Boats are  off-limits unless used in a controlled area.

	~Wine and cheese are for clans only.

	~Please include your name in the items you create, just in case we
		choose to restart dusk from scratch, so we can keep the
		items current gods use so they can use them in the future.

	~All items that have an increased attribute modifier need to be restricted,
		unless the modifications are insignificant enough to not cause
		unequal advantage of other players.

	~Do not "gecho" often. It confuses the players when you are invisible.

	~All commands that modify a players attributes MUST be restricted
		 to god use only, unless approved by Wildern.
