ScriptsSEE ALSO "help scripting" for a walkthroughFor a full list of script commands, type "help script commands"Scripts are used by Dusk to perform customizable tasks. You can use scripts to write spells, commands, tile movement, etc.To edit scripts, open/create them using the view and submit commands.There are two types of scripts, condition scripts and task scripts.Task scripts include spells, commands, and move actions.Condition scripts include can move, can see, and canAttack scripts.Task scripts are run from beggining to end, while condition scriptsevaluate the first statement and return it's value.For instance, a task script may say:Livingthing player param1chat player "Hello player!"endscriptWhile a condition script may say:hasItem trigger "long sword"This may seem like gibberish now, but read some of the example filesand it should begin to make sense soon. Good luck and happy scripting!
