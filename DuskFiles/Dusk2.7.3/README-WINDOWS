How to Run a Dusk Game on Windows for Dummies


If you need to contact me with questions or help on scripting my email is Cellzero1@aol.com 



or Instant Message me using AOL Instant Messanger. MY AIM name is Cellzero1. This help file is 



going to be written like a Dummies Book. All Credit goes to Tom Weingarten for the coding...



scripting...blah...blah..and all that. To make it short and Sweet "Good Job"



***NOTE**** There will be a help file for people with routers, proxies and Hubs to be included soon.




The Dusk game is really meant to be run on a Linux computer but it can be done on a Windows 



computer as well. I run windows and as most of us know....Windows sucks. Plain and Simple.



I use it and i hate it and its Blue Screen Of Death. Anyways.....there are 2 ways to host it. 



Via Internet Web Server ( not web site.) Or your own Computer. This is Obviously a help file 



for a gmae meant to be run on a windows computer. You can stop reading this if you access the



internet using a 56k modem, ISDN, or anything else that requires Dial UP. DSL might be a problem.



Its not a problem if you can leave your DSL online 24/7. I reccomend you have a Cable Modem.



Be aware if you host this on your computer there is a chance a hacker can get in and drop a virus



or whatnot. If you have a firewall it must be disabled for people to access your site. If you are



behind a Proxy...im still reading up on how to host a game with it. If you have a Router or Hub 



dont worry. Now....Lets get started.



goto  http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/win32/old/. Download Apache_1_3_14_win32_r2.exe



Install it and then dont do anything more with it. Inside the Apache directory find a folder called htdocs. 



First off...unpack the Dusk 2.x.Tar using WinZip which is probably done cause your reading this.

  

Its reccomended you extract it to your desktop. Now.. Rename the extracted dusk folder from 



whatever it is to just Dusk.



Open the Client.html found within the Dusk 2.x Folder When the page has opened in the Internet 



Browser window. Its reccomended you open this using Internet Explorer. Now...when the page loads



..right click so it opens the toolbar. Scroll Down an click on VIEW SOURCE. It should open a text



window. If you know HTML you can edit your page anyway you like.....but first....scroll down till



you see this...





<div align="left"> 

    <applet code="duskclient.class" archive="duskclient.jar" width="0" height="0">

		<param name="address" value="YOUR IP HERE"> 

		<param name="port" value="PORT YOU HAVE YOR SERVER SET TO HERE">

    </applet

  </div>

<hr>

</body>

</html>





What you really need to focus on is this:





		<param name="address" value="YOUR IP HERE"> 

		<param name="port" value="PORT YOU HAVE YOR SERVER SET TO HERE">

    



Dont delete or change anything else. Delete the writing: YOUR IP HERE  but leave the quotes.



Write in your IP. To find your IP address goto http://www.whatismyip.com . The Numbers on top



are your IP. It should be 12 numbers. Fill that into where you deleted YOUR IP HERE.



Delete the writing : PORT YOU HAVE YOR SERVER SET TO HERE . Write in the number 7420



Leave the Quotes as well. IT should now look like this: 







		<param name="address" value="123.123.123.123"> 

		<param name="port" value="7420">





*****NOTE**** I just used 123.123.123.123 as a fake IP. It should be your own IP. If you are 

behind a router or Hub you MUST goto that site written above to find out your REAL IP. 

WINIPCFG will only give you your NETWORK IP. You need the internet IP. So goto that site to

find it. 





Ok....Save this and close it. Then Close the Explorer Window. Now...scroll down



in the Dusk Folder and look for a file named Prefs. Open it with Notepad. 







*******NOTE******** MAKE SURE THE BOX THAT SAYS " ALWAYS OPEN THIS TYPE OF FILE USING THIS PROGRAM"

IS UNCHECKED!!! OR YOU WILL BE SCREWED!











The prefs should be opened in the notepad window. The Settings for the port should be 7420.



Where it asks for the RC address.....delete   http://wherever.you.put.your/rc/ 



Replace it with http:// (your internet IP here)/rc/



Make sure you leave the / on the end. Heres an example:



http://123.123.123.123/rc/



Go further down and edit what you like. Theyre Self Explanitory. Its Reccommended you make the 



Title size at most 100...... 30 is kinda small. Save this. DONT  CLICK SAVE AS. CLICK SAVE!



If it trys to make you save it as a .Txt find a way to make it NOT do that. It happens sometimes.



Im not sure on how to do that. Sorry....im good...but not that good. :) Now...time to test your



work so far. You need to download and install Java Runtime Enviroment 2 if you dont already have



it. Look on yahoo for it. I think the site is http://java.sun.com 



Make Sure you Download Java JDK and NOT Java SDK. YOU WANT JDK!!!! Unpack and install it.



Once you have done that....open a MS-DOS Shell. If you dont know what a Shell is...for an 



Operating System...its like opening 2 Operating Systems while using one. So....in other words..



Open an MS-DOS Window. If you dont know what the other shell is.....goto the beach. To Open an 



MS-DOS Shell if you dont know how to...click on  Start > Programs > MS-DOS PROMPT



When the Dos Windows opens... type CD\ and hit enter so you have a C:\ prompt. Someone asked me



what a Sea Prompt was. He claimed to have used windows for 2 years. If you have used Windows



for more than 6 months and dont know what a C:\ Prompt is...... You Outta be shot...Killed...



then Cremated and your ashes sprinkled over a CessPool. 



Your Ms-Dos window should look like this:



C:\WINDOWS> cd\



C:\>





now type cd\windows\desktop\(name of ur dusk folder) 



*im using dusk for the name of my games folder.



It should look like this now.



C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\dusk>







Next to the C:\Windows\desktop\dusk> type java DuskServer then press enter.



it should look like this:





C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\dusk>java DuskServer





Make sure you spell DuskServer with the capitals on D and S.



If it works...this  should be displayed :



Loading Prefs...

Loading Map...

Converting map to shortmap format....

Map Loaded 10/10

Loading Merchants

Loading Signs

Loading Mobs

Starting Ticks....





IF this comes up..Congradulations...So far things have worked.



Now.... inside the htdocs folder in the Apache Directory...make a folder named RC 



DO NOT PUT IT IN  YOUR DUSK FOLDER! JUST DIRECTLY IN THE htdocs FOLDER! ALSO MAKE SURE



THE FOLDER NAME IS IN LOWERCASE!



Inside the rc folder....make 2 more folders...name one of them images and the other audio



Inside the audio folder make another folder called sfx.



Goto http://dusk.wesowin.org/newrc/images



Download a copy of all 3 files. Sprites.gif, Map.gif, Players.gif.



*******NOTE******** ALL IMAGES MUST BE GIF FORMAT!



Copy them into the images folder.



Now to make some changes in your windows settings. Open Start > Control Panel > Network



Click ON the TCP/IP of your ethernet card then click on properties. Click the DNS tab.



Under host name type myhost and under domain name type mydomain.



The DNS number isnt needed. Apply and restart your computer so it can accept the new changes.



When Windows starts up again and finishes loading.... its time to test the Apache Server! :)





By this point for me it had been 2 weeks, 400 bangs of my head on the desk and Gallons 



of Coffee :)





goto Start > Programs > Apache Web Server > Start Service





A Ms-Dos window should open and the server will start. If you get an error saying:







APache.exe Couldnt Determine Servers Fully Qualified Domain Name. Using 127.0.0.1



as Server name!





Dont worry. It happens. You might need to play with your DNS settings a bit.



To test it...open an Internet Browser. Type in Http://(ur Ip as address)



EXample : Http://123.123.123.123





You should see a page with the Apache symbol and telling about apache. If so its setup perfect!



Now...make a folder in the htdocs folder...and name it Dusk. Into it copy the files Client.html



duskclient.jar from the Dusk folder on your desktop. Now...start up the DuskServer again. 



You remember? The First thing we did with Ms-Dos. When everything finishes loading....goto



your client page in the browser window.



Example: Http://123.123.123.123/Dusk/client.html



ALSO!!! MAKE SURE U SPELL THE FOLDER WHERE THE CLIENT IS  IN EXACTLY AS YOU NAMED THE FOLDER!



ITS CASE SENSITIVE!!!!



The client page on your computer should come up and the Java Applet should load bringing up 



the screen where you enter your name and password. Loggin and see what happens. If you get an



error saying -1 images loaded....your Prefs are looking in the wrong place for the rc folder.



If you get some Exception.Security message....the game cant get to the resources on your computer



The resources must be on your computer. You only start with a 10/10 map. To resize it...loggin as



God and the password is password. Teleport to the tile you want the map to end. Type resizemap.



When the map finishes resizing....save....for help on god commands goto



 http://dusk.wesowin.org/gods.html



Now...if you are behind a router or hub...consult your manual to read  about FOWARDING.



Find a way for your hub or router to foward all Http traffic to your computer. If you have a



Linksys router like me...you need to turn on Fowarding and DMZ hosting. Once you have setup 



FOWARDING you need to edit your TCP/IP properties again. You need to Specify yourself the IP



you set your router or hub to Foward traffic to. Then in gateway you need to put in the IP of



your router or hub. Thats Basically it. If you need more help...contact me. *Whew*
