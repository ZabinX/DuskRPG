News on Dusk:

These Dusk files were made back in 1999-2001.  The creator Tom Weingarten quit hosting Dusk around
2001, right before that happened my computer was hacked by some kids at school who were bummed that I became
a god with the character -Xyphoid- which was given to me when it's lvl was already built up a few thousand CP's.  He
gave me his charater to get me interested in the game.  I started to become friends with Tom.  I wanted to help 
with the game so I took the god test and some people recommended me so I became a god on Old Dusk.  I remember doing these
god sword quests for the best weapon in the game.  We would hide it somewhere really good and it would take 
3 or 4 hours sometimes before somebody found it.  

Dusk's coding was recoded in 2004-2005 by a guy made Lou.  He made the GUI look really nice.  I think he recoded the buggy
sourceforge files because I found some bad bugs and pointed them out to him.  Shortly afterward he abandoned his efforts
on Dusk to make his own game called SlothRPG.  I didn't get to see much of SlothRPG for the year or so he worked on it.
