--Help--

To move, use the arrow keys or the mouse.
For a list of commands, type "help commands"
To attack, use/get items, cast spells, or use skills, select items from the side
menus. It is recommended that you do not hold down the mouse button while making
a selection, but that you instead click once on the menu to open it, then choose
a selection, especially on Windows computers. Failing to do this may cause you
to make selections everytime the screen redraws whether or not you let go of the
mouse button
To buy items or train skills/spells, go to a merchant. When you are standing
directly on top of them, your merchant button becomes active.  Clicking it will
open a new window that is pretty self-explanatory.
To equip items you have, click the equipment button, and make your selections
in the window that opens.
To increase image quality, maximize the applet pop-up window.
To use commands, enter them into the same text box you entered your name and
password.
